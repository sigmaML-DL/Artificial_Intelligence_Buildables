My solution is a local text analysis tool.
Users can either paste text directly or upload a text file, and the tool performs multiple analyses in one click.
It includes:

Summarization using DistilBART and T5-small models

Tokenization comparison (GPT-2 vs BERT)

Optional features: language detection and sentiment analysis
